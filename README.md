# Q_Schrodinger1D_ZB
1D Schroedinger solver in Zinc-Blende semiconductor with non-parabolicity, m=m(z,E)

The non-parabolicity is implemented with the k.p 2bands Kane model in the conduction band while a k.p 6bands Luttinger model is used for the valence band

A database of the most common Zinc-Blende semiconductor III-V , IV-IV and II-VI is provided and can be adjusted.

A strain model is included.
